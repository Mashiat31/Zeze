# ZEZE


## Overview

ZeZe - meaning sister in cantonese, is an app that uses a smart algorithm that uses Data Driven Matchmaking for Moms and Services.
This is to function as a support system for women, made by women. We want to connect working women with other working women, like a sister helping another sister, by collaborating with other progressive business movements, we belive we can influence each other to share our struggles. This is also a platform for women to generate some revenue through content creation.

We want to include women’s perspectives and concerns more intentionally. We want to create a foundation for a new social and economic order among working moms.


 4 screens are availables : Explore, Mentors, Community and Zezes. You'll find some components like Card Component to pass props and variant. No frameworks UI like Bootstrap or Material UI are used.

- **Easy to use** 🤘
- **Made with Expo** ⚡
- **TypeScript supported** 🌞
